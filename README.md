# text-to-video-webui
Text-to-video-webui, inspired by @Oogabooga and @AUTOMATIC1111. Currently usable in it's current form without much customizations. Install requirements.txt and run (Also hope that the requirements.txt is all you need, I forgot to keep track so I'll be doing that this week).

# Roadmap
